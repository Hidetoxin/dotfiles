#
# .zprofile is for login shells. It is basically the same as .zlogin except that
# it's sourced before .zshrc whereas .zlogin is sourced after .zshrc. According
# to the zsh documentation, ".zprofile is meant as an alternative to .zlogin for
# ksh fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could
# certainly be done if desired."
#
# .zshenv -> .zprofile -> .zshrc -> .zlogin -> .zlogout
